            Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            The worldwide disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous impacts on the environment and the climate. The severe decline in planned travel has caused many regions to experience a drop in air pollution. In China, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 25 per cent reduction in carbon emissions and 50 percent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions, which one Earth systems scientist estimated may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months.<br> However, the outbreak has also disrupted environmental diplomacy efforts, including causing the postponement of the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and the economic fallout from it is predicted to slow investment in green energy technologies.

            BACKGROUND
        </div>
        <div class = "container">
            Up to 2020, increases in the amount of greenhouse gases produced since the beginning of the industrialization epoch caused average global temperatures on the Earth to rise, causing effects including the melting of glaciers and rising sea levels. In various forms, human activity caused environmental degradation, an anthropogenic impact.
            <br>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, measures that were expected to be recommended to health authorities in the case of a pandemic included quarantines and social distancing.
            <br>Independently, also prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers argued that reduced economic activity would help decrease global warming as well as air and marine pollution, allowing the environment to slowly flourish.

                <p>
                Lockdowns restricting travel and industry imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus have resulted in unprecedented
                reductions in deadly air pollution around the world.<br>Major cities that suffer from the world's worst air pollution
                have seen reductions of deadly particulate matter by up to 60% from the previous year, during a three-week lockdowns
                period.<br>A study compared levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5. The pollutant, 
                which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep 
                into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream, causing serious health risks.<br>Seven out of the 
                10 cities studied, including New Delhi, Seoul, Wuhan and Mumbai, saw significant improvements in air quality.

                    Waterways and aquatic life
                </div>
            <p>
                In Venice, the water in the canals cleared and experienced greater water flow and visibility of fish. 
                The Venice mayor's office clarified that the increase in water clarity was due to the settling of sediment
                that is disturbed by boat traffic and mentioned the decrease in air pollution along the waterways.<br>
                Demand for fish and fish prices have both decreased due to the pandemic, and fishing fleets around the
                world sit mostly idle. Rainer Froese has said the fish biomass will increase due to the sharp decline
                in fishing, and projected that in European waters, some fish such as herring could double their biomass.
                <br>As of April 2020, signs of aquatic recovery remain mostly anecdotal.

            Despite a temporary decline in global carbon emissions, the International Energy Agency warned that the economic
            turmoil caused by the coronavirus outbreak may prevent or delay companies from investing in green energy.
            However, extended quarantine periods have boosted adoption of remote work policies. As a consequence of the
            unprecedented use of disposable face masks, significant numbers are entering the natural environment, adding 
            to the worldwide burden of plastic waste.
            <br>The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) announced that a worldwide reduction in aircraft 
            flights due to the pandemic could impact the accuracy of weather forecasts, citing commercial airlines' use of 
            Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) as an integral contribution to weather forecast accuracy. The ECMWF 
            predicted that AMDAR coverage would decrease by 65% or more due to the drop in commercial flights.
